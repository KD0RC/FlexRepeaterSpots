# FlexRepeaterSpots
Flex 6000 Series radio utility to manage FM options using spots.

FlexRepeaterSpots is a utility for Flex 6000 series transceivers.  It places “permanent” spots on your SmartSDR screen (these spots do not time out like DX spots).  The spots indicate the frequency and name of FM repeaters.  A table of FM options is kept for each repeater spot such that clicking on a spot applies the appropriate options to the active slice (i.e. the slice that just landed on the spot).
